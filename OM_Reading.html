		2025 Paper 1: Characterizing the Structure of Optimal Stopping Policies, POM 16, presented by Rongqian Zhang.
    </p>
	This paper is a good text-book for optimal stopping problem. It gives condition for the structural properties, including cutoff policy and control band policy. The main contribution is to introduce the benefit function and marginal benefit function. 
	The monotone benefit function plus stochastic order requirement on the state transition will lead to the structural properties.
